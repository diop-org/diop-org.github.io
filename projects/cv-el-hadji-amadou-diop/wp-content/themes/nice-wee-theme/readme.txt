Readme: Nice Wee Theme

The Nice Wee Theme is a crisp, smart brown-on-white design with a right sidebar and horizontal page navigation. It might not look like it, but it is an adaptation of the default Kubrick theme and is based on the Scotproof design (www.scotproof.com).

A choice of header images is provided as a set of jpegs in the images/headers folder, so you can choose one that suits the theme of your website (see below), and you can also upload your own avatar.

See www.niceweesites.com/wordpress-theme/ for more information.

INSTALLATION
Upload the niceweetheme folder to wp-content/themes. Then select the theme through your Wordpress administration panel.

LICENCE
The Nice Wee Theme is released under the Creative Commons GNU GPL (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/). We'd appreciate it if you would keep the credit to us in the footer. 

AVATAR
The avatar can easily be changed by uploading an image titled me.jpg to the images folder; this will overwrite the existing avatar. Create your own custom avatar here: http://www.faceyourmanga.com or upload a photo. Make sure it's no wider than 190 pixels for it to fit nicely in the sidebar.

HEADERS
A range of 100x100 pixel headers (in the top left of the layout) is provided in the theme's images/headers folder, made from Photoshop's custom shapes. You can view them at www.niceweesites.com/wordpress-theme/header-icons/

To swap header, edit the stylesheet in the theme editor. Find #headerimg and change the background image to the one of your choice, eg change

background: #ffffff url('images/headers/flower4.gif') no-repeat;

to

background: #ffffff url('images/headers/tools.gif') no-repeat;

Then just 'Update File' to save your changes. To make your blog really personal, you could always create your own 100x100 pixel image, upload it to the images/headers folder and use that instead.
