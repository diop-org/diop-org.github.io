== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use FeedBurner to collect emails? =

= Can I add a Countdown? =

OK, I'm going to say it. Countdowns are super lame. Sites never launch on time. I highly suggest not putting a countdown on your site. 
If you feel you must have one then use the custom html and javascript option to add in your countdown code.
