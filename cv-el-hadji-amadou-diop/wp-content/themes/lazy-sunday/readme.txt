This theme supports custom post thumbnails (also known as Featured Images) but if no post thumbnails are set, it will attempt to pull the first image attachment at medium size. Images must be attached to the post (in the Gallery) for automatic image detection to work. You may want to use a plugin like Regenerate Thumbnails to size your images to better fit the theme.

The theme's custom menu displays up to 3 levels of menu items in drop-down format.
