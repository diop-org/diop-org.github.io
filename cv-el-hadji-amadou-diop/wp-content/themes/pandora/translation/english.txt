English language is in php files.

hu_HU.po file contain the english and Hungarian words.

If you wanna create other translation, then:
- Download Poedit.exe
- Open hu_HU.po in Poedit
- Look the English words at left side in Poedit, translate them to your language and override the Hungarian words at right side.
- Save as "yourlanguage_YOURCOUNTRY", simple: in Polish pl_PL.po
- when you saved .po file, then create an .mo file automaticly. This .mo file is the translation file. Po file is only for edit the translation.

If you wanna use English language, then you don't need any po or mo files.
