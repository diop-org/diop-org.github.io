1. A limitation that I have been asked to outline is that I never intend for the menu at the bottom of the screen to have a
secondary or dropdown menus. Which is why the theme is coded so that it will not display any dropdowns/secondary menus. This
options is however avaiable in the Premium features of this theme which can be obtained by visiting http://schwarttzy.com/shop/adventureplus/
